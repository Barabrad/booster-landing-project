# booster-landing-project
Final project for Introduction to Astronautics: a simulator that lands a rocket booster

Disclaimer: Our professor gave us the simulateBooster.m file (I added the suicideBurn() function later on), and a skeleton of the ControlBooster.m file.

This code, after making simplifying assumptions about the rocket and the environment, simulates a rocket booster maneuvering to land vertically at a slow speed.
